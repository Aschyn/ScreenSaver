# ScreenSaver
This project was primarily meant for use with a DIY smart fridge monitor. The goal was to display the Weather, Date/Time, as well as be able to view schedules from multiple calendars with images displaying from a folder in the background. It also was to have the ability to be used on multiple devices and orientations, as our DIY monitor is vertical and we plan on adding tablets.
